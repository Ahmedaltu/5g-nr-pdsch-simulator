# 5G NR PDSCH Link-Level Simulator

A MATLAB implementation of a 5G NR Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) link-level simulator, comparing classical and ML-based channel estimation methods. Built as part of Master's research at Aalto University.

## Results

The neural network channel estimator achieves a **4 dB SNR gain** over classical LS estimation at the 3GPP 10% BLER operating point, and approximately **1.5 dB gain** over MMSE — demonstrating that learned channel statistics outperform explicit covariance-based methods especially at low SNR.

```
BLER at 10% target (3GPP operating point):
  LS estimator    →  ~9 dB
  MMSE estimator  →  ~6 dB   (+3 dB over LS)
  NN estimator    →  ~4 dB   (+5 dB over LS)
```

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2022a or later
- 5G Toolbox (for `nrLDPCEncode`, `nrLDPCDecode`, `nrCRCEncode`, `nrCRCDecode`)
- Deep Learning Toolbox (for `trainNetwork`, `predict`)

## Running the simulation

```matlab
% 1. Train the NN channel estimator (~10 min on CPU, ~2 min on GPU)
cd matlab/ml
train_estimator

% 2. Run the full BLER sweep
cd ..
main_sim

% 3. Plot results
cd results
plot_bler
```

Simulation parameters can be adjusted at the top of `main_sim.m`:

```matlab
SNR_range    = -5:2:20;   % SNR sweep range (dB)
modOrder     = 4;          % 4=QPSK, 16=16QAM
codeRate     = 0.5;        % LDPC code rate
maxIter      = 50;         % LDPC decoder iterations
minErrors    = 100;        % min block errors per SNR point
```

## Channel estimation comparison

Three estimators are implemented and compared on the same received signal:

**LS (Least Squares)**
Divides received pilots by known pilot symbols. Fast and simple but the noise term is not suppressed — performance degrades significantly at low SNR.

**MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error)**
Applies a statistical correction to the LS estimate using the channel covariance matrix R_hh and noise variance. Significantly better than LS at low SNR but requires accurate channel statistics and matrix inversion.

**Neural Network**
A fully connected network (input → FC256 → FC256 → FC128 → output) trained on 100,000 synthetic channel realizations at random SNR between -5 and 25 dB. Learns to denoise and interpolate in a single forward pass without explicit R_hh computation. Outperforms MMSE at low SNR by implicitly learning channel statistics from data.
